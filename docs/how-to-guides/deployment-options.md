* Log into your Azure account:
 
```PowerShell
az login 
```
 
* If you have more than one subscription, select the subscription you would like to deploy to:
 
```PowerShell
az account set --subscription <SubscriptionId>
```
 
* Clone this repo and navigate to the Bicep deployment folder:
 
```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter.git
cd docs/deploy
```

## Deployment

### Deployment settings

The deployment options below provide a quickstart version which will set up your service with the default configuration, which is typically intended for testing or initial setup. The deployment options also allow for specifying specific configurations as needed for your service, during deployment.

Note: You are also able to update the service configuration post initial deployment, by redeploying with the updated settings.

#### Default settings

* **Security** - Security settings for the API endpoints are disabled by default. It is **strongly recommended** to enable security for your FHIR converter service.
* **Template store integration** - Template store integration is disabled by default. When template store integration is disabled, a Storage Account will not be provisioned with the deployment.
* **Default templates only** - When template store integration is disabled, the FHIR converter service will only have access to the provided default templates, with no access to custom templates.
* **Application Insights** - Application Insights is enabled by default. Application Insights will receive application logs and metrics for the FHIR converter service to be used for debugging/monitoring.

See [Parameters](#parameters) for details on the parameters that can be use to configure the deployment. 

#### Configurable settings

See [Parameters](#parameters) for details on the parameters that can be used to configure the deployment.

Otherwise, no. | empty string |

> [!Note]
> * 'serviceName' is not accepted as a parameter.
> * 'resourceGroupName' is not accepted as a parameter (this is determined by the scope of the deployment specified in the --resource-group parameter of the az deployment command).
> * 'templateStoreIntegrationEnabled' is not accepted as a parameter; to enable template store integration, provide the name of an existing Storage Account ('templateStorageAccountName') and Storage Blob Container ('templateStorageAccountContainerName') to store the custom templates.
> * If using Application Insights, the name of an existing Key Vault ('keyVaultName') storing the Application Insights connection string as a Key Vault Secret and User-Assigned Managed Identity for accessing the secret ('keyVaultUserAssignedIdentityName') must be provided.
> * 'location' of the Container App must be the same as that of the Container App Environment for the deployment to succeed.

### Redeployment scenarios

The following scenarios will require a redeployment of your service using any one of the above options:

* Update container image tag - If you intend to update your service to use the latest container image tag available, a redeployment will set up your service to pull the correct image tag specified.

* Updated settings - If you choose to update any configuration, a redeployment is required for the changes to take effect. Some examples are:

  * Enable or disable authentication
  * To update authentication audience/authority.
  * Switch to default templates or custom templates usage.
  * To update the Storage Account to pull custom templates from.
  * Enable or disable Application Insights telemetry.

* Custom template collection update - If you add/update any custom template in your Storage Account, a redeployment is required for the service to pick up the latest template collection and use that for conversion. You can redeploy using one of the options above, or manually restart your revision in the Azure Portal. To do the latter, go to your Container App's page in the Azure Portal, navigate to the "Revisions and replicas" blade under "Application", click on your revision name, and at the top of the "Revision Details" pane on the right, click "Restart".

### Additional Deployment Notes

* To view the progress of a deployment, navigate to the resource group in Azure Portal and select the 'Deployments' tab under 'Settings' in the left panel.

* Container App supports [zero downtime deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/revisions#zero-downtime-deployment).

  In case of updates to the service (image tag, configuration, etc.), a new container revision is created. If there are any issues in setting up the new revision, the endpoint is still available to use using the prior successfully provisioned revision. You can check the status and logs of the failing revision to debug issues with the deployment. Refer [Revisions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/revisions) for more information.

## Summary

In this how-to-guide, you learned how to deploy your FHIR converter service in Azure.

Once the deployment is complete, you can use the Azure Portal to navigate to the newly created Azure Container App to see the details of your service.
The default URL to access your FHIR converter service will be the application url of your Container App of the format:`https://<SERVICE NAME>.<ENV UNIQUE ID>.<REGION NAME>.azurecontainerapps.io`.

To get started with your newly deployed FHIR converter service, refer to the following documents:

* [Configure FHIR converter service settings](configuration-settings.md)
