# Snippet Concept

âš  **This document applies to the Liquid engine. Follow [this](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/tree/handlebars) link for the documentation of Handlebars engine.**

Snippets are a helpful tool when creating templates in the FHIR Converter.
Leveraging snippets allows you to reference them in multiple templates in the future, preventing you from having to rewrite the same code over again.
Within the FHIR converter release, there are four types of snippets: **Resource**, **Reference**, **Data Type** and **Code System**.
The following sections will describe the purpose of each category of released snippets and give you things to consider when you are creating your own snippets.

## Data Type

Data type templates are building blocks used to define the contents of a data field.
In most cases, the data types in HL7 v2 map to FHIR attributes as part of the FHIR resource.
The FHIR Converter includes a large number of data types as part of the release and new data type templates will be added as they are developed by the HL7 Community or provided via customer feedback.
As you create templates, you can create your own custom data types that map data fields in your implementation to FHIR.

Below is an example where a data type template is included.

```
{% include 'DataType/XPN' with XPN: PID.5 -%}
```

### Resource

Resource snippets are used to create one specific FHIR resource in the FHIR bundle.
Examples of these are patient, encounter, and condition.
What you need in your resource may be message type specific or you may be able to use the same resource template across multiple message types.

While the resource template maps to a single FHIR resource type, it may pull from multiple segments in an HL7 v2 message.
For example, the released patient resource for HL7 v2 pulls from PID (Patient ID) and NK1 (Next of Kin) segments to generate the resource.

Most of the resource templates will reference data type or code system snippets.
Resource templates are created by parsing the HL7 v2 elements and mapping those directly to the FHIR attribute.
When parsing these elements, the filters can be helpful to ensure that you are able to pull the exact data that you need.
For more details on the filters, please see the [filters summary](#TBD) page.

Below is an example where a resource template is included.

```
{% include 'Resource/RelatedPerson' with NK1: nk1Segment, ID: nk1Id -%}
```

### Reference

Reference templates allow you to create references between two related resources.
This is used to help ensure that the context of the data is carried across into the FHIR bundle.
Below is an example where the reference template creates a reference between the condition found in the diagnosis (from DG1 segment) and the encounter (PV1).
The reference ensures that when the condition resource is created, there is a reference to the correct encounter that the condition came from:

```json
{
    "resource":{
        "resourceType": "Encounter",
        "id":"{{ ID }}",
        "diagnosis":
        [
            {
                "condition":
                {
                    "reference":"{{ REF }}",
                },
            },
        ],
    },
},
```

When this template is called in the root template, you must specify the values for **ID** and **REF**.
Below is the example in the ADT_A01 template, where a reference template is included.

```
{% include 'Reference/Encounter/Diagnosis_Condition' with ID: pv1Id, REF: fullDg1Id -%}
```

## Code System

Code system templates define mappings of common codes from HL7 v2 to FHIR bundles.
An example of this is mapping "F" in HL7 v2 to "female" in a FHIR resource for gender.
The FHIR Converter contains a set of starting code systems that have been defined for the released templates.
You can also create your own code system templates.
These templates will typically use if/else statements to map values from HL7 v2 to values in FHIR.
You can see examples of this in the *CodeSystem* folder of the released templates.

Specifically, besides including code system templates, there is an alternative way to convert common codes from HL7 v2 to FHIR bundles.
The Converter provides a JSON file named *CodeSystem.json* in the *CodeSystem* folder and stores all mappings in it.
You can add or modify the mappings inside this file if needed.
This way is more **recommended**, as it avoids many if/else checks and leads to a faster processing speed.

You can use it with *get_property* filter.
Below is an example using this code system mapping.

```
"gender":"{{ PID.8.Value | get_property: 'CodeSystem/Gender', 'code' }}",
```

## Summary

Outside of the four types of snippets outlined above, you are welcome to create your own types of snippets.
In DotLiquid, snippets always start with "\_" and end with ".liquid" extension: *_\{name\}.liquid*.
