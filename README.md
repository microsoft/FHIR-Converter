# FHIR® Converter

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

For Healthcare IT teams and solution architects who want to integrate clinical data currently in different formats, the FHIR® Converter is an open source project that enables the conversion of legacy formatted health data to FHIR, expanding the use cases for health data and enabling interoperability.  

The FHIR Converter transforms HL7 v2 messages and CDA documents into FHIR bundles using templates that define the mappings between the two data formats. Leveraging the FHIR Converter, organizations can customize or create their own mapping templates based on their HL7 v2 or C-CDA implementation and transform them into FHIR bundles. These FHIR bundles are returned for further data manipulation or can be immediately persisted into a FHIR server, such as the [Azure API for FHIR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-api-for-fhir/). The FHIR Converter released to open source on Thursday March 6th, 2020 with support for HL7 v2 to FHIR conversion. On Friday June 12th, 2020, C-CDA to FHIR conversion was added to the OSS FHIR Converter.

The open-source FHIR Converter consists of the following functionality:

1. A set of starting templates, leveraging [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), to translate HL7 v2 messages or CDA documents into FHIR bundles.
1. A set of sample data to accompany the released templates.
1. A collection of APIs to convert data real time and assist in the template management and creation.
1. A Web UI editor to modify and create templates and test single data conversion to FHIR bundles.

## Deploy the FHIR Converter

The source code is available to be deployed in any manner you would like. The FHIR Converter can be run on-prem or in the cloud. To deploy the FHIR Converter, there are two key pieces of functionality. One is a web server (node.js) and the other is a persistence layer for the templates. To assist with easy deployment we have included two options below, one through Azure and one which will deploy locally. If you choose to deploy from another mechanism then the two options below, you will need to setup the storage for the templates.

### Deploy to Azure

To deploy in Azure, you will need to have a subscription in Azure. If you do not have an Azure subscription, you can start [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

Once you have your subscription, click the link below:

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FFHIR-Converter%2Fmaster%2Fdeploy%2Fdefault-azuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
</a>

Note that the Service Name will be included in the URL you will use to access the application. In addition, the API Key is automatically generated when you deploy the App Service but you can change this to another value if you want.

Once deployment is complete, you can go to the newly created App Service to see the details. Here you will get the URL to access your FHIR Converter (https://\<SERVICE NAME>.azurewebsites.net). 

If you need to find your API Key again or change the value take the following steps:

1. Navigate to your App Service
1. Under Settings, select Configuration
1. You will see CONVERSION_API_KEYS listed here. You can view the key and edit from this location.

### Deploy locally

Follow these steps to deploy a local copy of the FHIR Converter

Make sure that you have Node.js >=10.10.0 < 11.0 installed

```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/
cd FHIR-Converter
npm install
npm start
```

Once this completes, you can access Web UI locally at http://localhost:2019/

## Getting started

Now that you have deployed the FHIR Converter, you can get started with using the functionality. You will need to provide your API key when accessing service for the first time. We have included several documents to help you with template creation and management, understanding data conversion and some general summary guides that include functionality overview.

If you are ready to start modifying and creating your own templates, check out the [how to create templates guide](docs/template-creation-how-to-guide.md) as the first place to start.

Once you have your template complete, check out our [health architectures](https://github.com/microsoft/health-architectures/tree/master/HL7Conversion) which describe how to leverage the FHIR Converter in an end to end scenario.
