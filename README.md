# FHIR Converter

FHIR Converter is an open source project that enables conversion of health data from legacy formats to FHIR.

The first version of the FHIR Converter released to open source on Mar 6th, 2020. It used Handlebars template language and Javascript runtime. A new converter engine was released on Nov 13, 2020 that uses Liquid templating language and .Net runtime.

Both Handlebars and Liquid converters, and corresponding templates/filters, are supported by Microsoft. We recommend using Liquid converter for better alignment with [Azure API for FHIR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-api-for-fhir/), [FHIR Server for Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server), and [Microsoft Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/).

The following table compares the two converter engines:

|  | Handlebars Engine | Liquid Engine | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Release Date** | March 6, 2020 | Nov 13, 2020 |
| **Template language** | [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) | [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) |
| **Template authoring tool** | 1. Text editor <br> 2. Self-hosted web-app | 1. Text editor <br> 2. *VS Code extension**|
| **Supported conversions** | 1. HL7v2 to FHIR <br> 2. CCDA to FHIR | 1. HL7 v2 to FHIR <br> 2. *CCDA to FHIR** |
| **Available as** | 1. Self-deployed web service <br> (on-prem or on Azure)| 1. Command line tool <br> 2. *$data-convert operation of Azure API for FHIR** <br> 3. *$data-convert operation on  FHIR Server for Azure**|
**Available in Azure FHIR servers** | No | *Yes** |

**To be released soon.*

âš  Rest of this document is about the Liquid converter. For the Handlebars converter, refer to the [Handlebars branch](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/tree/handlebars).

The Converter makes use of templates that define the mappings between different data formats.
The templates are written in [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language and make use of custom [filters](docs/FiltersSummary.md), which make it easy with work with HL7 v2 messages.

The converter comes with templates for HL7v2 to FHIR conversion. These templates are based on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaFYPSSq4oplTvw_4OgOn6h2Bs_CMvCAU9CqC4tPBgk/edit#gid=0) created by the HL7 [2-To-FHIR project](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2-To-FHIR+Project). If needed, you can create new, or modify existing templates to meet your specific conversion requirements.

FHIR Converter with DotLiquid engine runs as a command-line tool.
It takes raw data as input and converts it to FHIR bundles.
These bundles can be persisted to a FHIR server such as the [Azure API for FHIR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-api-for-fhir/).

FHIR Converter with DotLiquid engine consists of the following components:

1. A command-line tool for converting data.
2. [Templates](data/Templates) for HL7 v2 to FHIR conversion.
3. [Sample data](data/SampleData) for testing purpose.

## Using the FHIR Converter

### Command-line tool

The command-line tool can be used to convert a folder containing HL7 v2 messages to FHIR resources.
Here are the parameters that the tool accepts:

| Option | Name | Optionality | Default | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |----- |----- |
| -d | TemplateDirectory | Required | | Root directory of templates. |
| -r | RootTemplate | Required | | Name of root template. |
| -c | InputDataContent | Optional| | Input data content. Specify OutputDataFile to get the results. |
| -f | OutputDataFile | Optional | | Output data file. |
| -i | InputDataFolder | Optional | | Input data folder. Specify OutputDataFolder to get the results.. |
| -o | OutputDataFolder | Optional | | Output data folder. |
| --version | Version | Optional | | Display version information. |
| --help | Help | Optional | | Display usage information of this tool. |

Example usage to convert HL7 v2 messages to FHIR resources in a folder:
```
>.\Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Liquid.Converter.Tool.exe -d myTemplateDirectory -e ADT_A01 -i myInputDataFolder -o myOutputDataFolder
```

### ID generation

The Converter provides a set of ID generation [templates](data/Templates/Hl7v2/ID) to help generate FHIR resource IDs from HL7 v2 messages.

An ID generation template does 3 things: 1) extract identifiers from input segment or field; 2) combine the identifers with resource type and base ID (optional) as hash seed; 3) compute hash as output ID.

The Converter introduces a concept of "base resource/base ID".
Base resources are independent entities, like Patient, Organization, Device, etc, whose IDs are defined as base ID.
Base IDs could be used to generate IDs for other resources that relate to them.
It helps enrich the input for hash and thus reduce ID collision.
For example, a Patient ID is used as part of hash input for an AllergyIntolerance ID, as this resource is closely related with a specific patient.

Below is an example where an AllergyIntolerance ID is generated, using ID/AllergyIntolerance template, AL1 segment and patient ID as its base ID.
The syntax is `{% evaluate [id] using [template] [variables] -%}`.
```
{% evaluate allergyIntoleranceId using 'ID/AllergyIntolerance' AL1: al1Segment, baseId: patientId -%}
```
