# FHIR Converter

FHIR converter is an open source project that enables conversion of health data from legacy formats to and from FHIR.  The FHIR converter uses the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and the .NET runtime.

The FHIR converter supports the following conversions: **HL7v2 to FHIR**, **C-CDA to FHIR**, **JSON to FHIR**, **FHIR STU3 to R4**, and **FHIR to HL7v2** (*Preview*).

The converter uses templates that define mappings between these different data formats. The templates are written in [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language and make use of custom [filters](docs/Filters-and-Tags.md).  

The converter comes with a few ready-to-use templates. If needed, you can create a new template, or modify existing templates to meet your specific conversion requirements. The provided templates are based off of HL7 v2.8. Other versions may require you to make modifications to these templates on your own. See [Templates & Authoring](#templates--authoring) for specifics.

## What's New?
The latest iteration of the *Preview* FHIR converter makes some significant changes over [previous versions](#previous-versions).

Some of the changes include:
 * Containerized API
 * Support Azure Storage for customer templates.
 * Removal of Azure Container repository dependency for custom templates.
 * Support for FHIR to HL7v2 conversion.

 All the documentation for the new *preview* FHIR converter API can be found in the [How to Guides](docs/how-to-guides/) folder.

## Architecture

The FHIR converter API *preview* provides [REST based APIs](#api) to perform conversion requests.

The FHIR converter APIs are offered as a container artifact in [Microsoft Container Registry](https://github.com/microsoft/containerregistry).
This image can be downloaded and run as a web service on a container hosting platform in your Azure tenant; that clients can target for conversion requests.

## Templates & Authoring

The FHIR converter API comes with several pre-built templates you can use as reference as to create your own.

| Conversion | Notes |
| ----- | ----- |
| [HL7v2 to FHIR](/docs/HL7v2-templates.md)| Important points to note for HL7v2 to FHIR conversion: [see here](docs/HL7v2-ImportantPoints.md) <br> Common FHIR Validator errors/warning you might run into, and their explanations: [see here](docs/HL7v2-FHIRValidator.md) | 
| [C-CDA to FHIR](/data/Templates/Ccda/) | | 
| [JSON to FHIR](/data/Templates/Json/) | | 
| [FHIR STU3 to R4](/data/Templates/Stu3ToR4/) | [Differences between STU3 & R4](/docs/Stu3R4-resources-differences.md) | 
| FHIR to HL7v2 (*Preview*) | |

### Concepts

In addition to the example [templates](data/Templates) provided there are several important concepts to review and consider when creating your own templates, including:
- [Filters summary](docs/Filters-and-Tags.md)
- [Snippet concept](docs/SnippetConcept.md)
- [Resource Id generation](docs/concepts/resource-id-generation.md)
- [Validation & post processing](docs/concepts/validation-and-postprocessing.md)

To use your custom templates, the FHIR converter API offers robust support for storing and retrieving your templates from Azure storage. For more information see: [Template Store Integration](/docs/how-to-guides/enable-template-store-integration.md).

## Deployment

You can deploy the FHIR converter API using the instructions found [here](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment-options.md).  The default deployment will deploy the FHIR Conventer API container hosted on Azure Container Apps.

## API

The conversion APIs process the provided input data of the specified format and use the specified Liquid template (default or custom) and return the converted result as per the transformations in the template.

Complete details on the FHIR converter APIs and examples can be found [here](/docs/how-to-guides/use-convert-web-apis.md).

## Troubleshooting

Some key concepts to consider:
* Processing time is related to both the input message size, template, and logic contained in the template.  If your template is taking a long time to execute make sure you don't have any unnecessary loops.
* The output of the template is expected to be JSON when the target is FHIR.
* When converting data to FHIR, [post processing](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/blob/main/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Liquid.Converter/OutputProcessors/PostProcessor.cs) is performed.  If you are seeing unexpected results, double check the post processing logic. 
* If you want a deeper understanding on how data is converted, look at the functional tests found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/blob/main/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Liquid.Converter.FunctionalTests/ConvertDataTemplateCollectionProviderFunctionalTests.cs)

Detailed troubleshooting options for your deployed FHIR converter API can be found [here](docs/how-to-guides/troubleshoot.md).
